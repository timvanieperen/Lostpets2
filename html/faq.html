		  <h4>How long should I look for my pet?</h4>
		  <p>The answer to this question is very personal. Some people search forever, some have to call off the search after only a few days. We encourage you to continue aggressively searching for your lost pet for at least 6 weeks. There are many news reports of pets being found months and even years after they went missing.</p>
		  <br>
		   <h4>How long do posts about pets stay up?</h4>
		  <p>In order to avoid clutter, all posts are automatically deleted after 6 months. If you still haven’t found a pet or an owner in that time you will have to make a new post.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>I found a pet, but its owner hasn’t contacted me for a long time, what should I do?</h4>
		  <p>We recommend getting in touch with one of the animal shelters in Breda. You can hand over most pets into their care. You can find more info on <a href="www.dierenbescherming.nl">www.dierenbescherming.nl</a></p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>Are dogs really stolen?</h4>
		  <p>Yes, pet theft does happen. In the past it was not as common, but as small breed dogs become more popular it is happening more often.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>What other ways can I search for my pet besides this app?</h4>
		  <p>Traditional ways like hanging flyers and posters, visiting shelters, and posting on social media can also be effective ways to aid your search</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>How do the notifications work in this app?</h4>
		  <p>By default you receive notifications every time that you receive a message from another user. You can also turn on notifications for every time someone finds a pet to help with your search. Likewise you can also get notified every time someone in your neighbourhood loses a pet so that you can help them out.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>My pet has a microchip. How come my pet has not been found? Isn’t the microchip like GPS?</h4>
		  <p>A microchip is not GPS. In other words, just because your pet has a microchip it does not mean that your pet can be located with satellites. A microchip is for identification purposes, but someone must use a compatible “wand” (usually available at veterinary clinics and shelters) to scan the pet and read the chip information. Then, they have to take that information and contact the microchip company and get your information.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>I got the pet’s microchip scanned, where can I find the owner’s information?</h4>
		  <p>On <a href="www.chipnummer.nl">www.chipnummer.nl</a> you can access 8 databases for pets in the Netherlands, You can search through these databases using the number from the scan.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>Does my dog remember his name? Will my pet come when I call?</h4>
		  <p>When a dog goes missing it can be a fearful experience for the pet. Do not count on your pet coming when called. Even the best-trained pet will not always come when called.</p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>My pet never crosses busy streets (or hates cars or noise), would my pet cross a busy street when lost?</h4>
		  <p>Of course, in your pet‘s normal routine they would not cross a dangerous street. However, being lost is a traumatic event and pets do act in unusual ways. In addition, if a stray dog or predator was chasing your pet, they would run in whatever direction is the safest at that time. In addition, frightened pets act erratically, crossing streets multiple times.</p>
